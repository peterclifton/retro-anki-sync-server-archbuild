# retro-anki-sync-server-archbuild
Build files for installing [retro-anki-sync-server](https://github.com/peterclifton/retro-anki-sync-server) on arch linux

As the purpose of [retro-anki-sync-server](https://github.com/peterclifton/retro-anki-sync-server) is just for me to try things out: I strongly recommend that you do **not**, under any circumstances, attempt to use this as 
your anki-sync-server.  If you are looking for an anki-sync-server to use please 
be aware that Anki now includes a 
[build in sync-server](https://docs.ankiweb.net/sync-server.html)
